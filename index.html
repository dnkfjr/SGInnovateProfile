                    <p>
                        I have <span class="lead">18 years</span> of working experience in the Oil & Gas Industry specializing in the design and installation analysis of offshore pipelines, which are used for transporting of oil and gas and also water within offshore fields or to an onshore facilities and vice versa. I have experience in management of design work by external party and procurement package, dealing with suppliers and service providers of offshore projects.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In the course of my work as design and installation analysis engineer, we regularly have to produce large volume of engineering calculations, post-processing of analysis outcomes as well as creating informative visualization that lead to insight for design and cost optimisations. I have picked up programming using <span class="lead">Python</span>, <span class="lead">VBA for Excel</span>,and <span class="lead">Matlab</span> through self-studying and have used them for writing analysis program, Process Automation and Data Visualisation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I aspire to develop further my skills in programming, software development and interfacing with hardware and use these skills to develop products and solutions that benefits people and improve quality of life.

                        <p>Although not a computer science major, I've done a fair bit of programming over the years even if 
                            not as a software developer. In my previous work as engineer in the oil and gas industry, I frequently used Python and VBA for Excel to develop programs to automate processes that are just too time consuming and tedious to be carried out by normal human and for solving physics equations.</p> 
                        
                        <p>Computers have always been something of interest to me. To understand better how computer works, I enrolled and completed Part 1 of <a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/6Y2XAUYXF2" target="_blank">"From Nand to Tetris"</a> via Coursera in 2015. The course gave me a good glimpse of how is it with just 0s and 1s computer is able to perform computations and does a lot more. </p>

                        <p>I did C programming while studying for my Bachelor Degree in Civil Engineering. About four years ago, due to slowdown in work, I again picked up C-programming and also took part in <a href="https://open.kattis.com/users/donikon-fajar" target="_blank">Katiss</a> online programming. </p>

                        <p>Currently I'm learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript for Web Development through edX course.</p>
                        <p>I have keen interest in robotics and would be learning programming of microcontroller for a robotics system kit that I have just obtained.</p>
